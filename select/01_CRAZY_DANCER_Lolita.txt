Fell the music come on dancin' like
You know
Move your body
Feel the rhythm now you really got me
Now
Through the night

I'm not alone if you call me baby
Wanna give you something special
Tonite
I'm afraid, I can't stay without you
Baby baby help me, make my dreams
Come true

You are my crazy dancer
Movin' to the beat
Do it just for me, baby
Now you're my crazy dancer
You're comin' from the heat
Baby stay with me... honey

I'm your baby and I love the way you are
Turn me on boy
Goin' crazy every time you stay with me
Through the night
